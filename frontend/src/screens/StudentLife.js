        The job market is one of the most competitive ones we have ever known.
        Very often, employers tell us that a degree alone is not indicative of a
        well-rounded graduate. It is ardent that during graduation, efforts
        should be to help the students develop an all-around personality. To
        achieve this goal, we should not just provide opportunities for students
        to achieve good academic results but actively promote the benefits of a
        broad curriculum to students. The Council will provide opportunities
        through which students can prepare themselves to succeed in varied roles
        they will have to undertake in the future. To recognize the importance
        and value of both academic curriculum and co-curricular activities in
        developing the range of skills and attributes is crucial for graduates.
