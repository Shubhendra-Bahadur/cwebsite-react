        The job market is one of the most competitive we have ever known. Very
        often employers tell us that a degree alone is not indicative of a
        well-rounded graduate. It is very strongly felt that during graduation
        effort should be made to help the students to develop all round
        personality. To achieve this goal we should not just provide the
        opportunities for students to achieve good academic results but actively
        promote the benefits of a wider curriculum to the students. The Council
        will provide opportunities through which students can prepare themselves
        to succeed in the many and varied roles they will have to undertake in
        their future life. To recognise the importance and value of both
        academic curriculum and co-curricular activities in developing the range
        of skills and attributes that are important for graduates.

        Introduction of a new course structure in 2017 have provided an
        opportunity to the undergraduate students to build a carrier to suit
        their interests and aspirations. The curriculum enables students to
        develop their subject knowledge, academic literacy and a range of
        complementary capabilities. Apart from academic curriculum there is
        co-curricular and extra-curricular activities which means any activity
        that falls outside the academic curriculum but it is part of Engineering
        curriculum. To keep the programme functional various councils have been
        formed.
