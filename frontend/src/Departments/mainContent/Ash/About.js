            In the wake of a new era, when there is a growing demand for humane
            and environment sensitive engineers, the English Department at
            Faculty of Engineering and Technology has taken a lead in the field
            of humanistic and communication studies by offering a specially
            curated curriculum that integrates discourses on humanities and
            social sciences along with the standard engineering education, at
            both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The study of human
            sciences plays an important role in the education of scientists and
            engineers by making their education holistic, going beyond
            specialized training in a particular area of technology and enabling
            them to think critically and sensitively for themselves and the
            society. Often, students are genuinely surprised to find that
            humanities and social sciences provide alternative modes of
            cognition and that not all problems of society have a technical
            solution. Technology, after all, does not exist in a vacuum. It is
            developed and deployed in a milieu that has both socio‐cultural and
            economic needs and constraints.
