          <p className='civil-achieve-description description pl-3'>
            <strong>18 October 2019, Lucknow</strong>: A workshop on{' '}
            <strong>
              ‘STADD pro. - Structural Analysis And Designing Program’
            </strong>
            was successfully conducted on 18 October 2019 in Faculty of
            Engineering and Technology, University of Lucknow, New Campus, by
            CADD Centre Training Services Pvt. Ltd. The workshop was organized
            by Training and Placement Cell, for the students of B.Tech, Third
            Year, Civil Engineering. <br />
            <br />
            The Objective of the workshop was to provide the students with an
            insight of Structure Modeling, Designing and Analysis, Integrated
            Design and Finite Element Analysis. The workshop consisted of
            Introduction about the software, types of Structures and their
            idealization, workflow of STADD Pro, structural geometry, node and
            beam creation, wind and seismic load on structure etc. Along with
            STADD Pro, the students were also introduced with some other
            software like AutoCAD, Revit Architecture, 3D Max, Etabs etc. which
            are equally helpful for the students for the better understanding of
            structural analysis .The Softwares were discussed by Er. Mohd. Faraz
            and Civil CADD Expert, Siddhant Singh, from CADD Centre, Lucknow.

            At the end of the workshop, students were amazed to see how software
            eliminates the countless man-hours required to properly load a
            structure by automating all kind of forces & solving a typical
            structural analysis problem with just a few clicks. The workshop
            started with excitement and went well with enthusiastic interaction
            throughout. All the students were rewarded with the Certificate of
            learning at the end of the workshop.

            <strong>Session 2: Building Design & Emerging Trends</strong>
            The session was taken over by <strong>Mr. Ali Ansari</strong>, a
            software expert in Building Design. He started the session with the
            introduction of various softwares involved in building design &
            their wide range of applications in different aspects of drafting &
            drawing. Initially, the students learned about the drawing &
            drafting concepts with the help of AUTOCAD followed by the
            structural design of a building. This involved the use of STAAD Pro
            for structural analysis of individual components of a building like
            beams & columns. The students understood these concepts with the
            help live demo of the analysis showcased in the software.
            <br />
            Further, he emphasized on the architectural importance of a
            building, moving on to another software i.e. Revit Architecture.
            Live models of buildings designed with Revit were shown to the
            students with a new trending concept of ‘Walkthrough’ which is used
            in live projects nowadays. Finally, the session moved on to another
            important aspect of Construction projects, i.e. Project Management &
            Project Planning.
            <br />
            At the end of webinar students raised several queries and expert
            answered their all questions satisfactorily. The webinar was
