## Overview

> Local setup should primarily be used only for testing or contribution.

This project is a website for '''insert name later'''

## Developing

### Built With

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

<ul>
<li>node>=8 <br/>
<li>npm(lastest) <br/>
<li>create-react-app(latest)
</ul>

### Setting up Dev

Here's a brief intro about what a developer must do in order to start developing
the project further:

Before we go ahead create a <strong>FORK</strong> by clicking on the fork button in the top right hand corner of this page

```shell
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/cwebsite-react.git
cd cwebsite-react/frontend
npm install&&start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Deploying / Publishing

give instructions on how to build and release a new version
In case there's some step you have to take that publishes this project to a
server, this is the right time to state it.

```shell
packagemanager deploy your-project -s server.com -u username -p password
```

And again you'd need to tell what the previous code actually does.

## Versioning

We can maybe use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the [link to tags on this repository](/tags).

## Configuration

Here you should write what are all of the configurations a user can enter when using the project.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Explain what these tests test and why.

```shell
Give an example
```

## Style guide

Explain your code style and show how to check it.

## Api Reference

If the api is external, link to api documentation. If not describe your api including authentication methods as well as explaining all the endpoints with their required parameters.

## Database

Explaining what database (and version) has been used. Provide download links.
Documents your database design and schemas, relations etc...
